## The Offer

### Don’t accept the first offer that comes in

This is a hard one. Depending on the job market at the time of your search and your current employment situation and personal financial situation, you may feel like taking the first offer that comes in. If you applied to the company it must be because you were interested in them and the actual position so you will likely seriously consider the offer. If the offer is not up to par and you have other opportunities, be confident in your skills and experience and reject the offer or try to defer it for a week.

### Once you accept an offer, keep to your word

I have seen a few cases where, in a hot market, people have received an offer and accepted it only for a better offer to come along shortly after. This can really affect your reputation. I saw an example of this where someone I know accepted a verbal offer and then the Friday before starting the new job they called and said they were not coming and instead they were going to a different company. The next week I was at lunch with a senior HR Director who knew people at the company where the verbal offer was accepted. He mentioned that it was only the second time in the company’s 10 year history that this had happened. For certain the reputation of this candidate has been compromised.

I recognize that it is difficult to get the timing right and have all of the offers coming in at the same time. But, if you applied for and accept a job, that means it was a good position and the pay was right otherwise you wouldn’t have accepted it in the first place.

Here’s my personal experience ... 

A few years ago I received an offer from a company and the moment I got back home from faxing in my acceptance the phone rang. The call was from an internal recruiter at another company with a verbal offer that was $10K higher than the one I just accepted. The company location was also 30 minutes closer to my home than the one I accepted. The recruiter tried to persuade me to call back the other company. I made it clear that I was sticking with my decision and ended up really enjoying the job.

### Once you land the Job

#### Thank everyone that helped you

Make sure to send a thank you note to or call each person that helped you along the way during your job search. You should thank everyone regardless of how significant the help was.

#### Keep connecting

The worst thing you can do is sit back go into obscurity once you have a new job. Keep your network alive. As Keith Ferrazzi says, 

> “a network is something you have not something you do”.

Best of luck!
