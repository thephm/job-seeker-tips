with a verbal offer that was $10K higher than the one I just accepted. The company location was also 30 minutes closer to my home than the one I accepted. The recruiter tried to persuade me to call back the other company. I made it clear that I was sticking with my decision and ended up really enjoying the job.

Once you accept an offer, keep your word and take the job.

## Once you land the Job

Thank everyone that helped you
Make sure that you send a thank you note to or call each person that helped you along the way during your job search. You should thank everyone regardless of how significant the help was.

### Keep connecting

The worst thing you can do is sit back go into obscurity once you have a new job. Keep your network alive. As Keith Ferrazzi says, 

> “a network is something you have not something you do”.

Best of luck!
