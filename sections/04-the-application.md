## The Application

OK, you've found an organization that you're interested in, you see or heard that they're hiring, any you're keen to apply.

### The “cover letter”

If you are submitting a resume by e-mail, include a brief and well-written "cover letter" a.k.a intro in the body of the e-mail instead of a separate Word attachment. Try not to do a cut and paste of some other cover letter. Highlight the key accomplishments relative to the position that you are applying for. Spend the time to ensure that you address the job-specific requirements that are not covered by your resume.

### Only apply for the job if you are qualified

It leaves a bad impression when you apply for a job that is not a match for your skills and experience. If you are extremely lucky someone else may read your resume down the road but you are better off waiting and applying for the "right job".

### Only apply to the job once

If you submit your resume to a specific person, odds are it will get into the company’s recruiting system. Submitting your resume multiple times wastes the HR department and the hiring manager's time. Sending in resumes via multiple entrance points can also make you look desperate for a job. Instead, follow-up a week after submitting your resume to confirm that it was received.

### Only apply to one position at a company at a time

In large companies there can be many positions available and it is tempting to apply for more than one.

This is one of my experiences …

I applied for one positions within a large organization and had not heard back for 6 weeks when I saw a second position that looked more interesting. So, I applied to the second position as well.  
Sure enough I received calls from two separate internal recruiters within the same company for interviews, one week apart, for each of the positions.

The interview for the first position occurred on a Thursday and went fairly well. The interview for the second position was scheduled for the following Wednesday. Then, on the Tuesday before the Wed interview I received a call from a recruiter. They wanted to re-schedule the interview to Friday. It seemed strange calling the night before my interview but I said OK.

On Wednesday I was sitting in my home office enjoying a cup of coffee and the phone rang. It was one of the recruiters calling to find out why I had missed the interview! It turns out the call on Tuesday was a mistake as the recruiter was calling to re-schedule an interview that had already occurred the previous Thursday.

### Try to choose the right position to apply for first

This also happened to me on my job search …

I saw two positions open at a company, one was a VP level and the other a first-level Manager. I knew the compensation for the first level management position was not going to be high enough and I felt strongly that I could be successful at the VP level position and the compensation would be the same or higher than what I was looking for. 
I applied for the VP position and got a bite. The phone interview happened a few days later. The questions being asked for the position were related to some things I did not have experience in (those not mentioned in the job description). The company asked the recruiter to “keep me warm” which typically means they are on the fence or are holding out for someone that is a better fit. 

After 6 weeks, the job search was still a little quiet so I asked the recruiter to put me in for the Manager position. I had a phone interview the next day, followed by a live interview with the Director a couple of days later. The following week I was brought in for a 3rd interview with the VP and the first question that was asked was why did I apply for a VP position and now this one! I explained that I was being kept warm for the VP position and that I had the ability to scale from high level strategy to tactical execution and since I was very interested in the company I would take a first level management position in hopes for progression later. I ended up with a verbal offer. Unfortunately the offer was too low and I had to reject it. 

### Preparing for the Interview

Prepare some excellent questions
Always have a few questions prepared for the interviewer. Too often as a hiring manager I have seen candidates come in with no questions or trivial questions. Come up with some innovative questions that show you have done your homework.

Keep in mind that questions you ask provide the interviewer with a sense of your concerns or issues. Ask questions of a positive nature and that relate to the position you are applied for.

I was looking at an opportunity for a leadership position in a large software company. The position was on the customer support side of the business as opposed to product development which is where most of my experience is. During the interview I asked a few questions that led the interviewers to believe I was interested in other types of positions at the company, specifically software development. In fact I was trying to find out more about the relationships between the functional groups within the company but the interviewers took this as a sign that I was not as interested in the position that I was being interviewed for. I didn’t get an offer for this one.

Don’t ask too many questions and keep an eye on the time. Interviewers usually give you time at the end of the interview for your questions. If you ask too many, it can either impress them Questions about the job duties, the company and its product or services show your interest. 

Questions about people who held the position previously

I like to ask the interviewer why they chose to work at the company.

My best example was a software company that was looking for someone to get the product development delivery to be more predictable and reliable. I used www.archive.org to look at old versions of their Web site and was able to get a compile a history of their product delivery dates. From this research I was able to come up with a couple of questions that showed I had done my homework on the company. The interviewer was blown away.

### Research the interviewer

Take some time to research the interviewer and learn about their background. Try to find some common ground. This could be a person you both know (be sensitive to dropping too many names) or a shared interest or hobby. Use Facebook to find the person’s interests and LinkedIn to get a sense of where they worked previously. With these two tools you can put together a solid profile on a person.

### Tie your experience to the position

You likely did this before you applied but just in case, go through the job description and make sure you can provide concrete examples of how your experience relates to the specific job. Go through every position in your career and make sure you can describe a key and significant contribution that you made to the company. I am surprised at how many people have poor answers when I ask what their significant contribution was in a specific position when the person had worked in the position for several years.

### Be positive

Your attitude and tone are very important. Answer all questions positively and enthusiastically but sincerely. Being over positive can make the interviewer feel you are insincere.
I have been hit by layoffs a couple of times. When interviewing for positions after being laid off, the interviewers would sometimes say they are “sorry” to hear that I was laid off. I quickly let them know that it is actually a positive experience since I get to look at other opportunities and expand my network. That approach seemed to work well. 

Never bad mouth a previous employer, manager, co-worker regardless of how you exited the company. Even when asked to describe difficult situations make sure that you end with a positive spin or outcome from the experience
