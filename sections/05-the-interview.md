## The Interview

CONGRATS you got an interview! The following is a number of tips that I’ve received from other people. Being an interviewee is not my strength so I don’t want to be presumptuous that I know how to do well in an interview. 

### Dress the part

Try to figure out the company culture and dress accordingly. I used to dress too casual for job interviews and then I went to the other extremen and started wearing a suit. I've since gone to the middle ground, business casual. It’s amazing the difference in reaction from the interviewers and sometimes it even makes you feel better when you’re dressed well. If you don't own something sharp, borrow from a friend! Wearing something nice further enforces that you're serious about the company and the position. Thanks to Ken for this tip.

### Arrive on time

Some people suggest that you arrive 15 minutes early for a live interview. I prefer when people arrive about 5 minutes before the interview. On a number of occasions I had candidates arrive half an hour earlier which, to me, is almost as bad as arriving late.

I actually had a candidate show up 10 minutes late for an interview once and he brought a cup of Tim Horton’s coffee with him. Another candidate was 15 minutes late because he got a speeding ticket on the way to the interview.

For online interviews, a couple of minutes early is fine. Find a quiet place and make sure your microphone and camera work before by doing a test run with a friend or family member using the same service the interviewer will be using.

### Talk to the receptionist

If you're going to a live interview, take time to say hello to the receptionist and, time permitting, ask them some questions. I usually ask how long they've been at the company and how they enjoy working there.

### Greet the interviewer politely and with confidence

Look the interviewers in the eye, smile, and if it's a live interview, greet them with a firm handshake but don't break their hand! 

During the interview sit upright and lean forward to show interest. Be an attentive and patient listener and never ever interrupt the interviewer while they are speaking. Make sure to speak clearly and confidently and to smile as you talk. This will convey your enthusiasm for the position.

### Look the interviewer in the eye

Always look the interviewers in the eye while answering questions. If it’s a panel interview this is harder but make sure to respect each person in the physical or virtual room. 

If they are interviewing you by panel the decision to hire will most likely based on consensus. So, you need to impress each person not just the ones who you are most interesting to you or the ones who ask the most questions.

I received some informal feedback from an internal recruiter shortly after a panel interview which I really appreciated. He let me know that I need to maintain eye contact and to “work the room”. I can make excuses such as being nervous but he was bang on as I look back and reflected on the interview.

### Think on your feet

Even though you made a list of questions they might ask and you practiced the answers, the interviewer is bound to ask questions you haven’t thought of. If you don’t know the answer, just admit it and don’t fumble around or guess what answer they want to hear.

Here's an example where I was lucky! I was being interviewed by the President of a company for a senior role.

Everything was going well, he was asking some typical questions and then he asked me to describe myself in one word, a word that would make him remember me. The word that came to mind was “execution” since I am great at tactical execution. But what I said was “executioner” and the interviewer laughed out loud and suggested that he pull out the sickle from the closet at the next interview! I quickly made light of the situation as well and we moved on. It turns out that he did remember me and I ended up with a second and third interview and an offer.

### Be yourself

Most of the time, the interviewer enters an interview wanting to hire you. They took the time to review your resume and book you for the interview and they want to fill the position. So things are in your favour going in.

Answer the interviewer’s questions based on your experiences and feelings not based on what you think the interviewer wants to hear. They are looking for sincerity and a good interviewer can quickly determine whether you are working them versus being yourself.

Have fun during the interview! 

### Find out the next steps

Often the interviewer will let you know what the next steps are. If not, just ask them what their timeframe is to close the position and what the typical next steps are. Their answer or lack thereof
