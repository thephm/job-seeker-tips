## The Waiting Game

### Patience is key

The hardest thing about the job search is waiting to hear back after you apply for a position but being patient is very important. As an applicant, we think that companies should get back to us right away especially since we believe we are the right person for the job. On the flipside, hiring managers are very busy doing their day jobs and recruiters see 100’s if not 1000’s of applicants. Sometimes they will not get back to you right away.

### Following up is a fine art

Take care when following up on a job application. Timing is important when job searching. In many cases, hiring is not well planned or scheduled and there is rarely enough time for the hiring manager or HR to do a proper review of resumes or to read all of them.

Here are some tips on followup:

- If you get a live interview, ask the hiring manager or interviewer(s) for their business card. If they give you a business card, it leaves the door open for you to contact them later. If it's a virtual interview, ask for their email address.
- Try to get your person on the inside to do the follow up for you if they were the ones that passed along your resume. 

This person will be able to find the status of the hiring and learn a bit more about where you sit in respect to the opening. They can also help to let you know if the person has been busy on a project, away on a business trip, off sick, or simply isn’t interested. All of the above is useful information.

- Follow-up phone calls can be very effective but respect the recruiter’s time and the hiring manager’s time
- If the job ad says "no phone calls", then don't call
- Don't become a "fatal attraction" applicant by phoning hourly or daily and not leaving a message or by leaving too many messages
- On the opposite end of the spectrum, not following up can mean a missed opportunity
- Don't phone multiple people and send e-mails and voicemails within a short period of time. If you do phone, make sure to call from a quiet place, not from a payphone or from a cell phone or a room full of screaming children. If you leave a voicemail, make sure your message is clear and concise.

Here's an example where following up (and luck) paid off:

I was interested in a company and was able to get the e-mail address of one of the Directors from an ex-colleague.
I sent an unsolicited “teaser” e-mail to the Director without a resume.

I received an e-mail back immediately asking me to send him my resume. I sent my resume and received no response. I made a follow-up call each week for the next three weeks and there was still no response. So, I moved on and luckily found a job elsewhere.

Seven months later I was looking to make a move so I sent a "not sure if you remember me, but …" e-mail to the same Director. He responded immediately with "I'm no longer the right person, but try Bob".

I e-mailed Bob who replied immediately asking for my resume. I sent him my resume but then received the silent treatment again. I waited a week and called again, left a voice message but received no response. I waited one more week and followed up with an e-mail stating that I had a couple of other opportunities and would still like to talk to him.

Within an hour he sent me an e-mail asking to call him on his cell. I waited for half a day and called him. Bob asked if I could come in the following day for an interview. The next day I went through 5 hours of interviews with 6 people and that evening I had a verbal offer.

When I started working at the company, I quickly realized that Bob was not very organized and that my follow-up was very important!

This example is not the norm but it does show that follow-up can pay off. Keep in mind that your mileage may vary.
