## Appendix A : Examples of what not to do

The following section provides some real-world examples of what not to do when applying for a job. These are from applications I have reviewed over the past many years. Of course all private information has been removed.

### An odd email subject

The following was an email from someone applying for a job, seems they did not know the difference between a job opening and a job offer.

```
Subject: Resume for job offer

Hello,

I am responding to job offer for position of Senior Developer posted to ... 
```

### The strangest cover letter

The following is a snippet of an email application I received:

```
Subject: Applying for the developer position
Importance: High
Dear Employer:
Why human rule the world?

Human are lazy, so they invented different tools to get more and do less; human draw together, so they can sent monkeys up to the outer space; human are curious, so they print their footsteps all over this world.

I have all these best ‘humanities’, plus 4+ years hands-on <skill> project experience, over 9 years edification in I.T. and excellent English communication skills. I extracted myself in the 2 pages resume; 
```

### An interesting heading

This profile I had to read a couple of times and I still really do not understand it:

```
PROFILE
When my work is “1 to n”, I feel satisfied because the many benefit from the few
```

### An interesting accomplishment

This was an accomplishment listed in a Software Developer’s resume:

```
Introduced usage of Hibernate tool, which allowed us to ge toff with no DB-programmer.
```


### Check out the “To:” address on this email

This person email’d his resume to 7 companies at the same time, listing each company in the “To:” address. Almost as bad was the “p.s” at the bottom which referred to a specific job title and job number at one of the companies I presume. The position I had open was for a Software Developer!

```
To: jobs@company1.com; careers@company2.com; info@company3.com; eaclarke@company4.com; jobs@company5.com; HR@company6.com; info@company7.com
Subject: Attention: Human Resources
Hello Sir/Ma'am,
   Attached to this e-mail is my for resume. While waiting for your an opportunity to discuss my qualifications,
thanks.
ps...Junior Software Test Engineers (Jobs #2105) 
```

### Remember to “accept all changes”

Ensuring all changes are accepted and change tracking is turned off if you use Microsoft Word. I have seen some interesting stuff over the years.
