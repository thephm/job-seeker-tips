## Introduction

This document is the result of some notes that I have taken over the years as a hiring manager and as a job seeker. All of my examples are generalized so that nothing confidential is shared.

I do not profess to be an expert hiring manager nor an excellent job seeker. These are just my experiences, opinions, and some lessons learned. Hopefully youâ€™ll find a few tips that help you in your job search.

If you have any comments or suggestions, please drop me a note by sending an email to job-seeker-tips at janlabs dot com. Also feel free to pass the top link or any page along to friends or family members that you think might benefit from these tips.
