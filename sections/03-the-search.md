## The Search

This section covers the actual job search.

### The 80/20 rule

You should spend about 80% of your time networking and the other 20% on traditional job search techniques. A couple of good networking books are:

1. Never Eat Alone by Keith Ferrazzi, ISBN 0-385-51205-8, www.keithferrazzi.com 
2. Monster Careers – Networking by Jeff Taylor, ISBN 0143036017

### Do some basic research

Before applying to a company, make sure it is somewhere you want to work. Most companies have enough information online that you should be able to walk into an interview with a fair understanding of their business.

### Know what you are worth

It is important to know what the market will bear when considering your asking salary. Base salary is very important but also consider the total value along with other benefits such as yearly bonuses, stock plans, profit sharing, and RRSP plans.

One site that I stumbled upon and which was very useful is www.payscale.com. It allows you to obtain salary reports based on answering a few questions. Of course, it’s only as good as the data that goes in from other job seekers but I found it to be extremely useful.

### Impress and respect the internal recruiter

I am surprised at how many people try to bypass the recruiter or the HR “filter” as some people like to call them. In many cases, these people have the ability to filter your resume, or perform an initial assessment of your skills and fit for a company.

If you impress the recruiter, it is quite possible that he or she will go out of their way to help you. If you had an interview and you are following up with the recruiter, accept what the recruiter tells you. Asking to speak with the hiring manager directly can leave a bad taste, or worse, it can be insulting to the recruiter.

I have seen cases where an internal recruiter has gone above and beyond for me because I established a relationship with them at the first interview. In one case, I had informally met with the recruiter regarding a position that had not officially been created. Prior to the chat, he sent me a draft of the job description. We hit it off and he immediately went to the Director and convinced them to move the hiring process up by one month and begin interviewing. Three days later I had a panel interview with 4 people in the company.

Keep in mind that internal recruiters move from company to company so you may end up talking with this person again. 

### Use the online tools

There are a number of online tools for the job search. The traditional www.monster.ca and www.workopolis.com are still good sites. Specifically with Monster, make sure you update your resume at least once a week. Thanks to Ken and Inna for this tip.

The best tool I found back in 2012 was www.indeed.com which provides aggregated searching across job sites as well as corporate career pages. This site had a great filtering capability along the left hand side. You can search by company, job type (contract, full time), and location. You can also setup alerts for a number of searches to save you time. This way you receive an email each day with a list of the new positions that were found. Another site similar to this is www.eluta.com but I found it to have less features.

In 2022, there are a bunch of newer sites like www.ziprecruiter.com and ca.talent.com or if you want to do some consulting, check out a site like upwork.com.

### Practice your interview answers

There are a ton of resources online where you can obtain a list of typical interview questions and styles. Compile a list of these questions and write up your answers to each of them.

For behavioral interviews, make sure you can answer all of the behavioural questions with a specific situation in your work history, what specific action you took, and what the outcome was.

Coming up with this list of questions and answers will take a while but it is well worth the time spent especially if you have a bad memory like me.

#### What is your weakness?

I separate this question out because it is often asked and a tough one to answer.
Who wants to talk about their weaknesses?

I have seen this stock answer mentioned a few times so I would avoid it “Unfortunately, I am a perfectionist and set high expectations for myself and I always expect my peers to demand as much of themselves.”

Interviewers can tell when you’re being sincere. Pick a real weakness but put a positive spin on it and make sure the weakness is not in an area that is a key requirement for the position!

#### The warm introduction

If you can, try to apply via a warm referral. To do this you will need to know someone on the inside. In some cases this could be an employee or it could be a supplier to the company or a customer of the company.

Many people think they cannot do this because they don’t have a network. Everyone has a network, just some have larger networks than others. You really don’t need to know that many people. If you find a target company that you are interested in, use tools like LinkedIn or Facebook to find a connection to someone in the company.
