The following is a number of tips that I’ve received from other people. Being an interviewee is not my strength so I don’t want to be presumptuous that I know how to do well in an interview. Since this is a set of tips for job seekers, I needed to include some information in here!

### Dress the part

I used to dress casual for job interviews but more recently I have been wearing a suit. It’s amazing the difference in reaction from the interviewers and sometimes it even makes you feel better when you’re in a suit. Wearing a suit further enforces that you are serious about the company and the position. Thanks to Ken for this tip.

### Arrive on time

Some people suggest that you arrive 15 minutes early for an interview. I prefer when people arrive about 5 minutes before the interview.

On a number of occasions I have seen candidates arrive half an hour earlier which, to me, is almost as bad as arriving late.

I actually had a candidate show up 10 minutes late for an interview once and he brought a cup of Tim Horton’s coffee with him. Another candidate was 15 minutes late because he got a speeding ticket on the way to the interview.

### Talk to the receptionist

Take the time to say hello to the receptionist and, time permitting, ask them some questions. I usually ask how long they have been at the company and how they enjoy working there.

### Greet the interviewer politely and with confidence

Look the interviewers in the eye, smile, and greet them with firm handshakes. During the interview sit upright and lean forward to show interest. Be an attentive and patient listener and never ever interrupt the interviewer while they are speaking. Make sure to speak clearly and confidently and to smile as you talk. This will convey your enthusiasm for the position.

### Look the interviewer in the eye

Always look the interviewers in the eye while answering questions. If it’s a panel interview this is harder but make sure to respect each person in the room. 
If they are interviewing you by panel the decision to hire will most likely based on consensus. So, you need to impress each person in the room not just the ones who you are most interesting to you or the ones who ask the most questions.

I received some informal feedback from an internal recruiter shortly after a panel interview which I really appreciated. He let me know that I need to maintain eye contact and to “work the room”. I can make excuses such as being nervous but he was bang on as I look back and reflected on the interview.

### Think on your feet

Even though you made a list of questions and you practiced them, the interviewer is bound to ask questions you haven’t thought of. If you don’t know the answer, just admit it and don’t fumble around or guess what answer they want to hear.

I was interviewed once by the President of a company for a senior role.

Everything was going well, he was asking some typical questions and then he asked me to describe myself in one word, a word that would make him remember me. The word that came to mind was “execution” since I am great at tactical execution. But what I said was “executioner” and the interviewer laughed out loud and suggested that he pull out the sickle from the closet at the next interview! I quickly made light of the situation as well and we moved on. It turns out that he did remember me and I ended up with a second and third interview and an offer.

### Be yourself

Most of the time, the interviewer enters the interview wanting to hire you. They took the time to review your resume and book you for the interview and they want to fill the position. So things are in your favour going in.

Answer the interviewer’s questions based on your experiences and feelings not based on what you think the interviewer wants to hear. They are looking for sincerity and a good interviewer can quickly determine whether you are working them versus being yourself.

Have fun during the interview. 

### Find out the next steps

Often the interviewer will let you know what the next steps are. If not, just ask them what their timeframe is to close the position and what the typical next steps are. Their answer or lack thereof
